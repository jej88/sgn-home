The following scripts are used to integrate BAC data into 
current agp and tpf contig/gap files:

limit_bac_output.pl:

	this file is used to select biased the BLAST 
	information that is of importance to you.  You can 
	specify the parameters of the search near the top 
	of the file.

	The script requires in input of the BLAST results to
	be searched and a file containing two columns: first 
	the BAC id and second the correct BAC length.



bac_chr_position.pl:

	Able to input options.  -d for the folder containing the 
	current agp and tpf files, and -t for a transformation 
	file.  The transformation file contins two colums first 
	of BAC ID and second of GenBank ID.  This gives output 
	as many BAC IDs, put in the print (can be output wiht 
	">" to a error file), are not in current transformation 
	file (mainly chromosome 8).  In this case file uses 
	original BAC ID.

	This script requires an input of the BAC data to be 
	integrated (from limit_bac_output.pl), and a folder 
	containing both the current agp and tpf files for 
	chromosomes of interest (use all chromosomes if you 
	do not know which your BAC information will map to).
	It is possible to input BLAST information not from 
	BACS, and the script should run this similarly,
	however this has yet to be tested.

	This script looks at each chromosome individually, 
	taking the BAC information mapping to the chromosome 
	and adding it to the chromosome information.  After 
	all BACs have been checked the start positions are 
	used to sort the data	After sorting is completed, 
	orientation	information is added and BACs are 
	used to replace current contigs and gaps where 
	possible.

	A standard error output is generated when an unknown 
	gap is removed by a BAC, as the estimated length of 
	all such gaps is 100bp.  These locations will need to 
	be tested to find the correct gap length, and test if 
	the BAC truly spans the gap. The following data start 
	and end positions as well as contained information 
	will need to be corrected accordingly.  Until more 
	information is known the script assumes 100bp to be 
	the correct length of such gaps.

	The script will automatically create a new folder in the
	location the program is called.  Within this folder there
	will be new agp and tpf files created for each chromosome
	named the same as the input files.  The output files will 
	contain the BACs associated with the given chromosome, as
	well as all the BAC and contained information.


itag2annotate.pl:

	This file is to integrate .gff3 files to annotation for 
	Genbank. It currently is not working correctly, it will 
	not note the multiple elements of a given type, and needs 
	work, possibly re-writing.
