This script is for integration of BAC data into a tpf file of contig's and gaps.

requires three files, two inputs.

The list of BACs from a BLAST is required as well as an agp file for the chromosomes being interpreted (a single file containing all agp files is preferred).

The tpf files associated with the inputed agp is required to be in the same location and under the same name (with an additional .tpf on the end) as the agp file.


The output is a tpf file, similar to the one inputed. However the resulting file will have BACs replacing the contigs and gaps in the appropriate locations on the given chromosomes.
